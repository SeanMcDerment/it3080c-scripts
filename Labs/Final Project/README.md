Game are meant to be fun and I built this game to be fun but I wanted to add more of a challege then my 
previous iteration on it. That is why I created different dificulties. This project is useful to me because I 
can take a break from whatever is going on in life and just play a game that I have created. It feels good to 
finish a project like this and it is useful in the sense that you get some enjoyment out of it and relaxing to play.
